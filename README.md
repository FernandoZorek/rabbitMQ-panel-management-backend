## Tech

This project uses several open source projects to function correctly::

- [Docker] - Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization;
- [Nginx] - Advanced Load Balancer, Web Server, Reverse Proxy;
- [Node.js] - JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine;
- [Express.js] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js;
- [Feathers.js] - The API and Real-time Application Framework;
- [Rabbit MQ] - RabbitMQ is a reliable and mature messaging and streaming broker, which is easy to deploy on cloud environments, on-premises, and on your local machine;
